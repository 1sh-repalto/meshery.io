    <h4 class="sub_headings">Google Summer of Code Participation</h4>
    <p>As a self-service engineering platform, Meshery enables collaborative design and operation of cloud native infrastructure.</p>

    <p>As a mentee, you will learn cloud native infrastructure management techniques, and will increase your understanding of distributed systems challenges and how to properly implement best-practice patterns of modern software design.</p>
        
    <p>To best position your candidacy, start participating in the project so that you can self-assess your readiness and interest. We work hard to guarantee your success. That starts with your own internal reflection of whether the project and community are a fit for you.</p>
        
    <p>Engage in an area in which you think you can make an impact. And if you are being impactful and consistent, eventually we will bring the internship to you. Moreover you will take away exactly the same real value that an internship offers: experience and relationships.</p>

      <h4 class="project-list">Project 1. Support for Azure in Meshery</h4>
    
      <p class="project-item"><b>Description:</b>

              Enhance Meshery's existing orchestration capabilities to include support for Azure.  The <a href="https://azure.github.io/azure-service-operator">Azure Service Operator</a> (ASO) provides a wide variety of Azure Resources via Kubernetes custom resources as first-class <a href="https://docs.meshery.io/concepts/logical/models">Meshery Models</a>. This involves enabling Meshery to manage and orchestrate Azure services and their resources, similar to how it handles other Kubernetes resources.  The project will also include generating support for Azure services and their resources in Meshery's Model generator.
      </p>
    
          <ul class="project-item">
            <ol style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><b>Expected outcomes:</b></ol>
            <ol>
                Meshery will be able to orchestrate and manage all Azure services supported by ASO. This includes the ability to discover, configure, deploy, and operate the lifecycle of Azure services through Meshery. The Meshery Model generator will be updated to automatically generate models for Azure services, simplifying their integration and management within Meshery. This will be an officially supported feature of Meshery.

    <h4 class="project-list">Project 2. End-to-End testing of Meshery CLI using BATS</h4>
    
            
    <p class="project-item"><b>Description:</b>
    Meshery CLI is the command line interface for Meshery. Meshery CLI, otherwise known as `mesheryctl`, is a client of Meshery Serverâ€™s REST API. The other client is Meshery UI and just like Meshery UI, Meshery CLI is a <i>user experience</i>. It provides a way to interact with Meshery and perform various operations such as installing, configuring, and managing cloud native infrastructure.</p>
    <p>Each test case is designed to mimic the experience that a Meshery CLI user might have while interacting with `mesheryctl` in their terminal of choice. In this sense, `mesheryctl` tests run end-to-end with each pull request submitted containing changes to either the /mesheryctl or the /server directories in the meshery/meshery repository, ensuring that changes included in those pull requests do not break the existing CLI functionality.</p>
    
    <ul class="project-item">
      <ol style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><b>Expected outcomes:</b></ol>
      <ol>A signifcant set of new test cases written for `mesheryctl`.</ol>
