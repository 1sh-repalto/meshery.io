## Meshery v0.8.0: A Major Leap Forward for Cloud Native Management

We're thrilled to unveil Meshery v0.8.0! This release marks a significant milestone in Meshery's journey, introducing powerful features and enhancements that streamline cloud native infrastructure management.  Since the release of [v0.7.0](/blog/meshery-v07-release-announcement), we've been busy building a more robust, extensible, and user-friendly platform. Here's a glimpse of what's new: We are excited to announce the release of Meshery v0.8.0! This release includes a number of new features and improvements.

## Registry & Models: Enhanced Management and Control

The [Meshery Registry](https://docs.meshery.io/concepts/logical/registry) takes center stage in v0.8.0, acting as the central repository for all capabilities known to Meshery. This includes models, components, relationships, and policies. <img src="/assets/images/posts/2024-03-29-models-designs-legos/five-legos.png" style="float:right; width:50%;" />

* **First-Class Resources:** Models and Relationships are now treated as first-class resources, enabling easier management, import/export functionality, and dynamic generation.
* **Server Model Generator:**  Directly retrieve Helm Charts or Kubernetes manifests using the new Server Model Generator.
* **SelectorSets for Relationships:** Define complex relationships between components with greater precision.

### OCI Support: Streamlined Packaging and Distribution

Meshery v0.8.0 embraces Open Container Image (OCI) as the standard format for packaging and distributing Meshery [Designs](https://docs.meshery.io/concepts/logical/designs) and [Models](https://docs.meshery.io/concepts/logical/models). This ensures seamless sharing and integration across the ecosystem.

* **Publish and Share:** Import and export Meshery models using Meshery's UI, CLI, or ReST API. Push and pull models and designs from OCI registries, including AWS ECR, GitHub Registry, and Docker Hub.
  
### Spaces: Organize and Collaborate

[Environments](https://docs.meshery.io/concepts/logical/environments) - Group your deployment targets (on-premises servers or cloud services) into logical environments for better organization.
[Workspaces](https://docs.meshery.io/concepts/logical/workspaces) - Boost team collaboration with dedicated workspaces, facilitating shared management and configuration of cloud native infrastructure.

## Extensibility & Extensions: Expanding the Meshery Ecosystem

[Helm Kanvas Snapshot](/extensions/helm-kanvas-snapshot) - Helm Kanvas Snapshot is a Helm chart that allows you to take snapshots of your Kubernetes resources and sync them with Meshery Server. This extension makes it easier to manage and track changes to resources over time.

Looking ahead, additional extensions are planned for v0.9, including [kubectl MeshSync Snapshot](/extensions/kubectl-meshsync-snapshot) and [kubectl Kanvas Snapshot](/extensions/kubectl-kanvas-snapshot). These extensions will allow users to take snapshots of their Kubernetes resources and sync them with Meshery Server. This will make it easier to manage and track changes to resources over time.

## Meshery Catalog: Discover and Share

<img src="/assets/images/posts/2024-02-17-simplifying-cloud-infrastructure-and-kubernetes-management/meshery-catalog.png" width="100%" />

Meshery Catalog functions much like a cloud marketplace, providing a user-friendly interface for browsing, discovering, and sharing configurations and patterns for cloud native infrastructure. In v0.8, Meshery Catalog expands its capabilities with user-defined models, robust filters, and Artifact Hub integration.

* **Contributed Models:** Learn how to share your [models with the community](/blog/share-your-meshery-models) and discover new ones.
* **Artifact Hub Integration:** Browse and publish Meshery Designs on Artifact Hub, expanding the reach and accessibility of reusable configurations.

<a href="https://artifacthub.io" target="_blank"><img alt="Artifact Hub Kinds" src="/assets/images/posts/2024-04-09-designs-on-artifacthub/meshery-designs-on-artifact-hub.png" width="50%" align="right" /></a>

Browse the [catalog](/catalog) or learn more about [how it works](https://docs.meshery.io/concepts/catalog).

You can now browse Meshery Designs in the [Artifact Hub search](https://artifacthub.io/packages/search?kind=24&sort=relevance&page=1).
An integration with Artifact Hub is delivered in this release, allowing you to [publish your Meshery Designs to the Artifact Hub](https://deploy-preview-1990--mesheryio-preview.netlify.app/blog/designs-on-artifact-hub), a community-driven catalog of Kubernetes applications with [over 200 Meshery designs](/blog/200-meshery-designs-on-artifacthub) to date and more on the way.

### UI: A Fresh, Modern Look

The Meshery UI receives a major refresh with the adoption of the [Sistent design system](https://layer5.io/projects/sistent) and Material UI v5.

* **Enhanced User Experience:** Enjoy a more intuitive and visually appealing interface.
* **New Components:** Leverage a wide range of new components from the Sistent design system.

### CLI: Increased Coverage and Functionality

The Meshery CLI boasts increased code coverage and a full migration from Apps to Designs.

* **System Report:**  Diagnose issues quickly with the new `system report` command.
* **Enhanced Model Support:** Dedicated commands for managing models, relationships, components, connections, credentials, and policies.

### Documentation and Learning

* **Playground Learning Paths:**  Interactive, cloud-native tutorials within Meshery Playground offer hands-on learning experiences.

### Build, Test, Release: Improved Processes

* **End-to-End Testing:**  Increased focus on end-to-end testing with a goal of 50% coverage.
* **Playwright Adoption:**  Transitioning from Cypress to Playwright for more robust testing.
* **Automated Test Results:** Stay informed with automatically published end-to-end test results.

## Looking Ahead

While v0.8.0 delivers significant advancements, we're already working on v0.9.0! Planned features include:

* **Adapters & Performance Management:**  Evolving `meshes.proto` to `adapters.proto` and externalizing Nighthawk for improved performance testing.
* **Basic Adaptive Load Controller:**  Introducing adaptive testing capabilities for more dynamic performance analysis.
* **Custom Telemetry Provider:** Enabling user-defined dashboards and metrics for greater flexibility.
