We are excited to announce the release of Meshery v0.8.0! This release includes a number of new features and improvements, including:
 in the time that measures 0.7 has released, there have been many new features and enhancements added to the project.

* **Lifecycle Management:** Support for AWS and GCP, Static Model Generation sources AWS, GCP as K8s CRDs, Relationships for AWS, and more.  
* **Registry & Models:** Refactor Model and Relationship as first-class resources, Model import/export, Server Model Generator for direct Helm Chart or K8s Manifest Retrieval, Dynamic Generation via URL (Chart, Manifest) upon Design import, and SelectorSets for Relationships.  
* **Open Container Image (OCI) Support:** Adopt OCI as the packaging and distribution format for Meshery Designs, Patterns, Filters, and Models.  
* **Spaces:**
  * [Environments](https://docs.meshery.io/concepts/logical/environments) - Environments are how you organize your deployment targets (whether on-premises servers or cloud services) into resource groups.
  * [Workspaces](https://docs.meshery.io/concepts/logical/workspaces) - Meshery Workspaces act as central collaboration point for teams.
* **Extensibility & Extensions:** Extensible Authorization and Expand Meshery's Integration with Artifact Hub.  
* **Docs:** Playground Learning Paths: Cloud Native tutorials with Meshery Playground and more.  
* **UI:** Complete incorporation of RTK, Switch to Sistent as the theme provider, Sistent Design System, and Support for Material UI v5.  
* **CLI:** code coverage goal: 50% and Full migration from Apps to Designs.  

### [Registry](https://docs.meshery.io/concepts/logical/registry) - Meshery Registry is a database acting as the central repository for all capabilities known to Meshery. These capabilities encompass various entities, including models, components, relationships, and policies.

This release also includes a number of bug fixes and performance improvements.

* **Build, Test, Release:** Server End-to-End Testing coverage goal: 25% and Transition from Cypress to Playwright.  

Not included in this release are the following features, which are planned for future releases:

* **Adapters & Performance Management:** Evolve meshes.proto to adapters.proto and Externalize Nighthawk.

**Get Involved!**

We welcome your contributions to Meshery! Please see our contributing guidelines for more information.  
v0.8 includes a focus on the Meshery Registry which is significant in that the Meshery Registry is a database acting as the central repository for all capabilities known to Meshery. These capabilities encompass various entities, including models, components, relationships, and policies. Capabilies are registered in different ways depending upon your Meshery deployment.

Registration of connections and credentials

Meshery models support for commands:

Meshery CLI now has dedicated support for models, relationships, components, connections, credentials, and policies as first-class commands.

### Open Container Image (OCI) Support

Adopt OCI as the packaging and distribution format for Meshery Designs, Patterns, Filters, Models ([#6447](https://github.com/meshery/meshery/issues/6447)) ([Design Spec](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AmNnwtMbYSVQ00TZRYtEZBJQTrPtH_S51ZG2UiwBGqs/edit))

## Extensibility & Extensions

[Helm Kanvas Snapshot](/extensions/helm-kanvas-snapshot) - Helm Kanvas Snapshot is a Helm chart that allows you to take snapshots of your Kubernetes resources and sync them with Meshery Server. This extension makes it easier to manage and track changes to resources over time.

Looking ahead, additional extensions are planned for v0.9, including [kubectl MeshSync Snapshot](/extensions/kubectl-meshsync-snapshot) and [kubectl Kanvas Snapshot](/extensions/kubectl-kanvas-snapshot). These extensions will allow users to take snapshots of their Kubernetes resources and sync them with Meshery Server. This will make it easier to manage and track changes to resources over time.
