We are excited to announce that Meshery Designs are now available on Artifact Hub as a new artifact kind. Meshery Designs allow you to create, manage, and deploy complex architectures seamlessly, which make them a great addition to the growing collection of Artifact Hub artifacts such as Helm charts, ArgoCD templates, and <a href="https://artifacthub.io/docs/topics/repositories/" target="_blank">many more</a>.

Making Meshery Designs available through Artifact Hub is an important milestone and was only possible through excellent support from the Artifact Hub team.
