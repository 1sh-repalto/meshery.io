patternInfo: |
  This design installs Istio operator in istio-operator namespace and deploys demo profile of Istio service mesh. Moreover, this design adds a custom annotation for CryptoMB Private Key Provider configuration to ingressgateway pod. In Istio, CryptoMB private key provider configuration can be applied mesh wide, gateways specific or pod specific configurations using pod annotations. A regular TLS configuration only uses a private key. When a private key provider is used, the private key field is replaced with a private key provider field. It contains two fields, provider name and typed config. Typed config is CryptoMbPrivateKeyMethodConfig, and it specifies the private key and the poll delay. CryptoMB private key provider is an Envoy extension which handles BoringSSL TLS RSA operations using Intel AVX-512 multi-buffer acceleration. When a new handshake happens, BoringSSL invokes the private key provider to request the cryptographic operation, and then the control returns to Envoy. The RSA requests are gathered in a buffer. When the buffer is full or the timer expires, the private key provider invokes Intel AVX-512 processing of the buffer. When processing is done, Envoy is notified that the cryptographic operation is done and that it may continue with the handshakes. The Envoy worker thread has a buffer size for eight RSA requests. When the first RSA request is stored in the buffer, a timer will be initiated (timer duration is set by the poll_delay field in the CryptoMB configuration). When the buffer is full or when the timer expires, the crypto operations are performed for all RSA requests simultaneously. The SIMD (single instruction, multiple data) processing gives the potential performance benefit compared to the non-accelerated case.

  Ensure that IstioOperator is registered as a MeshModel in order so that the custom configuration can be applied.
